# GAS-Models
All type of statistical analyses using generalised autoregressive score (GAS) models

This repository should form a basis to future applications of GAS models to different types of data. 
The main interest is to determine the forecasting performance of these models.

As follows a personal selection of papers introducing GAS models and providing examples of their application:
